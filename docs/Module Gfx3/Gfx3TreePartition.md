# Gfx3TreePartition

A 3D binary tree space partition.
- inherit from: TreePartition
## Constructors
- **new Gfx3TreePartition**(maxChildren: number, maxDepth: number, aabb: Gfx3BoundingBox): Gfx3TreePartition   
   - **maxChildren**: The maximum number of children that a node in the tree can have. It determines the branching factor of the tree, i.e.
   - **maxDepth**: The maximum depth or level of the tree partition. It determines how deep the tree can be divided into smaller partitions.
   - **aabb**: The top bounding box of the tree partition space.
