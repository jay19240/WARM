# Gfx2TreePartition

A 2D binary tree space partition.
- inherit from: TreePartition
## Constructors
- **new Gfx2TreePartition**(maxChildren: number, maxDepth: number, rect: Gfx2BoundingRect): Gfx2TreePartition   
   - **maxChildren**: The maximum number of children that a node in the tree can have. It determines the branching factor of the tree, i.e.
   - **maxDepth**: The maximum depth or level of the tree partition. It determines how deep the tree can be divided into smaller partitions.
   - **rect**: The top bounding rectangle of the tree partition space.
